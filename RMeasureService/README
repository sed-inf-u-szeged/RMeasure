# Using the rMeasureService
#------------------------------------------------
Usage:
$ sudo /etc/init.d/rMeasureService start
where rMeasureService is the rMeasureService.sh, which copied into the /etc/init.d/ directory
$ sudo /etc/init.d/rMeasureService stop


Root priviligies are required to access the MSR registers and to control the parallel port bits.

In case of RAPL Measurement to read the model-specific registers (MSRs).
    NOTES:
        The msr driver is not auto-loaded. You need to use
        the following command to load it explicitly before using the rMeasureService:
            $ sudo modprobe msr
