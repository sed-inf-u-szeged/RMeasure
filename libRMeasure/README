To use librmeasure, we need to install the following libs:
    libxmlrpc_client++ libxmlrpc_client libxmlrpc++

And need to set the following enviroment variables:

    SCOPESERVICE // value is the path where is the ScopeControlService
        export SCOPESERVICE="http://localhost:8080/RPC2"
    RMEASURESERVICE // value is the path where is the RMeasureService
        export RMEASURESERVICE="http://localhost:8081/RPC2"

-------------------------
compile

#if all measurement supported:
make SCOPE=1 RAPL=1 TIMER=1

#if only timer supported:
make TIMER=1
